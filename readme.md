# zai's NUS stash

hi. i'm [m. zaidan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mzaidanbsani/), a compsci student in NUS.
currently i'm a rising penultimate year student (enrolled 23/24, (planned) graduation may'26). 

not an outstanding student (not straight As!!!), but here are my notes anyways
saw a few seniors put theirs online, and i was extremely grateful, so here goes nothing. extremely big shoutout to @jovyntls and her [cheatsheets](https://github.com/jovyntls/cheatsheets) which helped me understand how to start making mine and were a good frame of reference.

my comprehensive notes can be found at what i call ["the vault"](https://zaidansani.github.io/thevault/).

i also made a module planner on google sheets, which may be helpful if you need it. there's one for CS students, and a more general one as well. you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K3Uwi-M5q3lUXoWpmeIonP6WZ_Nedx9rc3auVxN--cQ/edit?usp=sharing). it's supposed to help for planning for double counting and keeping track of your seniority and stuff, but it is pretty much a permanent work in progress. do lmk if there's any changes i shld make!

my module reviews are also in the file ```modreviews.md``` if you need some info for the courses, might be helpful i guess. (Not updated)

**note:**

i did not get A for every mod, which clearly means that there might be errors in some of the cheatsheets here LOL. however, everyone knows that the cheatsheet does not make you automatically get an A anyways, so uh, use at your own risk
